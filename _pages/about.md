Nice to meet you! I am Yiyang Zhang (张一阳), currently a second year Master student at the the School of Information Science and Technology of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hxGs4ukAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Prof. Yongdong Zhang</a>. Before joining USTC, I obtained my B.E. degree in Communication Engineering from Shandong University in 2023.

My research interest includes LLMs and Recommender Systems. 

Feel free to contact me at [yiyangzhang@mail.ustc.edu.cn](mailto:yiyangzhang@mail.ustc.edu.cn).
