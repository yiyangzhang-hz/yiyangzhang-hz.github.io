<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>

Nice to meet you! I am Yiyang Zhang (张一阳), currently a second year Master student at the the School of Information Science and Technology of University of Science and Technology of China (USTC), supervised by  <a href='https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=hxGs4ukAAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao'>Prof. Yongdong Zhang</a>. Before joining USTC, I obtained my B.S. degree in Communication Engineering from Shandong University in 2023.

My research interest includes LLM and recommender systems.
